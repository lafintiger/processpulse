I think that companies that develop AI will continue to hide information about there developments and agenda for their systems. These companies are driven by one thing...power. Whether it be money, control, influence, or image people are greedy as long as people are in control they will tailor there systems to bring nothing but rewards back to them. No matter what rules or laws are put in place they will dodge these loopholes just like the rich do in taxes to get themselves closer to more gain. People can believe in ethics and the common but what people say and do are two different things especially when it comes to people in power...the people who control the development of their systems. Even if we put people in line to check them whos to say they aren't bought or paid off like other government official who already are. There is so much room for error and advantage i do not think its possible for it to stay ethical. The big reason why AI won't take over the world is because these companies need a world to take advantage of so they will make sure it develops to only help them. Maybe at some point it might go far but I won't wipe us out in a Terminator or Age of Ultron manor.
