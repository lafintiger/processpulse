what is the test and correction for blood chemistry

In Applied Kinesiology (AK), the **test and correction for blood chemistry** involves muscle testing procedures to identify functional imbalances related to blood sugar, protein metabolism, electrolyte levels, and other nutrient-based systems. The corrections may include nutritional support, neurolymphatic or neurovascular reflexes, cranial or spinal adjustments, and other AK methods.

### ✅ **Testing for Blood Chemistry Imbalances**

AK practitioners assess **blood chemistry** by using **indicator muscles** and applying specific challenge substances, reflexes, or nutritional tests. Here are the primary components and how they're tested:

---

#### 🔹 **1. Blood Sugar Handling**

Muscle testing is used to assess functional hypoglycemia or poor sugar handling.

**Tests:**

* Challenge with glucose, sugar, or insulin-related substances (e.g., small sugar cube under tongue).
* Indicator muscle (e.g., deltoid or psoas) will weaken in the presence of sugar dysregulation.
* Muscle may also weaken after ingestion of a small sugar dose if blood sugar handling is poor.

**Associated Reflexes:**

* Neurolymphatic reflexes:

  * **Pancreas:** Bilateral 7th intercostal space (anterior), T7-T8 lamina (posterior)
  * **Liver (for gluconeogenesis):** Right 5th and 6th intercostal spaces (anterior), T5-T6 lamina (posterior)
  * **Adrenals (for counter-regulatory response):** 1 inch lateral and 2 inches superior to umbilicus (anterior), T11-T12 lamina (posterior)

**Correction:**

* Nutrition: chromium, vanadium, B vitamins, adrenal support
* Stimulate neurolymphatic and neurovascular reflexes
* Adjust vertebrae (e.g., T7-T9 for pancreas/liver)
* Emotional stress handling may be considered if blood sugar handling worsens under stress

📘 **Reference:** Blood sugar testing and correction is described in detail in the sections on “Organ Nutritional Reflex Testing” and “Functional Blood Chemistry Handling” in the AK clinical texts.

#### 🔹 **2. Protein Deficiency or Malabsorption**

Used to identify protein assimilation issues or poor stomach acid production (related to HCl and pepsin activity).

**Tests:**

* Challenge with amino acids or HCl tablets placed under the tongue
* Weak indicator muscle may strengthen with correct supplement

**Associated Reflexes:**

* **Stomach (HCl):** Left 5th intercostal space (anterior), T5 lamina (posterior)
* **Small Intestine:** Bilateral 8th–10th intercostal spaces (anterior), T8–T10 laminae (posterior)

**Correction:**

* HCl supplementation (e.g., betaine HCl with pepsin)
* Stimulate stomach reflexes
* Consider cranial corrections if temporals or occiput are involved (e.g., vagus nerve influence)

📘 **Reference:** “Digestive System Testing” section and reflex charts in the AK manual cover this procedure.

#### 🔹 **3. Electrolyte Imbalance (e.g., Calcium, Potassium, Sodium)**

Electrolyte handling may affect muscle integrity, nerve function, and hydration.

**Tests:**

* Use of electrolyte solutions or tablets (calcium lactate, potassium chloride, sodium bicarbonate)
* Test muscles before and after challenge
* Fatigue or cramping muscles may test weak due to mineral depletion

**Associated Reflexes:**

* **Parathyroid (Calcium metabolism):** 2nd and 3rd intercostal spaces (anterior), C3–C4 laminae (posterior)
* **Kidneys (electrolyte excretion):** 1 inch lateral and 1 inch superior to umbilicus (anterior), T10–T11 laminae (posterior)

**Correction:**

* Appropriate mineral supplementation (e.g., calcium lactate, potassium gluconate)
* Correct cervical subluxations (C3–C5) for parathyroid involvement
* Check for chronic stress or adrenal involvement (adrenal–electrolyte axis)

#### 🔹 **4. Anemia / Oxygen-Carrying Capacity**

This can be indirectly tested through muscle fatigue, postural testing, and challenge with iron or B12.

**Tests:**

* Place desiccated liver, iron, or B12 under tongue
* If muscle strengthens, it may indicate deficiency

**Associated Reflexes:**

* **Liver and bone marrow:** liver points and upper thoracic vertebrae (e.g., T3–T5)
* Evaluate cardiovascular reflexes if fatigue is systemic

**Correction:**

* Iron (heme form), folic acid, B12
* Liver support
* Adjust thoracic spine and related cranial faults

📘 **Reference:** Blood chemistry assessment involving oxygen transport is discussed in the “Energy Systems Testing” chapter.
