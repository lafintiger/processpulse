## Your Grade Breakdown (100 Points Total)

### Part 1: AI Collaboration Process (50 points)

#### 1.1 Starting Point & Initial Thinking (10 points)

**What I'm looking for:**
- Your original ideas BEFORE AI influenced them
- Clear research question or position you're exploring
- Genuine curiosity or uncertainty (it's okay not to have all the answers!)
- Prompts that show YOUR thinking, not just "write me an essay"

**To earn full points:**
- Start your chat by explaining what YOU think and why
- Identify what you're uncertain about or want to explore
- Ask AI to help you think, not to think for you
- Show your intellectual starting line clearly

**Examples:**

✅ **Excellent Starting Prompt:**
"I believe that social media has mostly negative effects on teen mental health, but I'm not entirely sure why I believe this or if there's solid evidence. I've seen some studies but also know people who say it helps them connect. Can you help me explore both the research supporting my view and the strongest arguments against it? I want to really understand this issue."

❌ **Poor Starting Prompt:**
"Write me a 5-page essay on social media and teen mental health."

- Clear progression from rough to refined thinking

**To earn full points:**
- Don't accept the first response—ask AI to go deeper
- Challenge weak reasoning or vague claims
- Request multiple versions or approaches
- Ask "why?" and "what about...?" frequently
- Show that you're in control of the process

**Examples:**

✅ **Excellent Engagement:**
- Student: "This explanation seems too simple. What are the counterarguments to this position?"
- Student: "These three points feel disconnected. Can you help me find the underlying thread?"
- Student: "I'm not convinced by this reasoning. What's the strongest evidence against what you just said?"
- Student: "This paragraph is too generic. Give me a more specific example with actual data."

❌ **Poor Engagement:**
- Student: "Okay, looks good."
- Student: "Make it longer."

- Show awareness of AI limitations
- Verify important facts independently when possible

**Examples:**

✅ **Excellent Research Engagement:**
- "What peer-reviewed studies support this claim? Give me the actual citations."
- "Can you verify this statistic? Where does it come from?"
- "This sounds made up. Is this a real source or are you hallucinating?"

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ The "Vending Machine" Approach
**Mistake:** "Write me an essay on [topic]" → copy-paste → submit
**Why it fails:** Shows zero thinking process, no iteration, no intellectual growth
**Your grade:** Will fail or nearly fail all process criteria (70% of grade)

### ❌ The "First Draft is Final" Approach
**Mistake:** Getting AI response, making minor tweaks, calling it done
**Why it fails:** No iterative refinement, no depth of engagement
**Your grade:** Poor marks on iteration and critical engagement

### ❌ The "Confirmation Bias" Approach
**Mistake:** Only asking AI for information supporting your initial view
**Why it fails:** No perspective exploration, no intellectual growth
**Your grade:** Low marks on perspective-seeking and intellectual honesty

### ❌ The "Trust Everything" Approach
**Mistake:** Accepting all AI outputs as fact without verification
**Why it fails:** No critical thinking, no research process
**Your grade:** Poor marks on research and critical engagement

### ❌ The "Hide the Mess" Approach
**Mistake:** Editing chat history to only show polished exchanges
**Why it fails:** Dishonest, prevents assessment of actual process
**Your grade:** Fails transparency and integrity (10% of grade), plus I can't assess your real process

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How long should my chat history be?**
A: Quality matters more than quantity, but expect minimum 6-10 substantial exchanges. Complex topics should show more. If you're engaging deeply, it naturally gets longer.

**Q: What if I use multiple AI tools?**
A: Great! Submit chat histories from all of them. This shows sophisticated engagement.

**Q: Can I use AI to help me edit and polish?**
A: Absolutely! Just document it in your chat history. This is part of the process.

**Q: What if my thinking doesn't change much?**
A: That can happen if you thoroughly explore counterarguments and still find your position sound. But you should show evidence of seriously engaging with opposing views and explain why you maintain your position.

**Q: Do I have to agree with AI's suggestions?**
A: No! In fact, pushing back on AI and explaining why you disagree often shows better critical thinking.

**Q: What if AI gives me wrong information?**
A: Perfect! Document how you discovered it was wrong and how you corrected it. This shows critical thinking.

**Q: Can I start over if my first approach doesn't work?**
A: Yes! Include both chat histories. False starts are valuable—they show your thinking process.

**Q: How detailed should my process narrative be?**
A: 1-2 paragraphs minimum. Should specifically identify: where you started intellectually, key turning points, how your final position compares to initial thoughts, and what you learned.

**Q: What AI tools can I use?**
A: Any you want: ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Google Gemini, etc. Just document everything.

**Q: Will you judge me for mistakes or confusion in my chat history?**
A: No! Confusion and mistakes are signs of genuine learning. I'm grading your process and growth, not expecting perfection.

## Example: What Great Work Looks Like

### Sample Process Journey (abbreviated):

**Prompt 1:** "I think universal basic income is a bad idea because people won't work if they get free money. But I realize I don't actually know much about this beyond my gut feeling. Can you explain the main arguments both for and against UBI?"

**[AI responds with overview]**

**Prompt 3:** "Okay, that's helpful but pretty surface level. What's the actual empirical evidence? Have any places tried this? What happened?"

**[AI provides info about trials]**

**Prompt 5:** "These pilot programs seem to show people DO keep working. That surprises me. What's the strongest argument for why UBI might NOT work? I want to understand the best case against it, not a strawman."

**[AI provides counterarguments]**

**Prompt 8:** "The inflation concern makes sense. Can you find me actual economic analysis of this? I need sources I can verify."

**[AI provides sources]**

**Prompt 10:** "I checked that 2018 Roosevelt Institute study you mentioned. It's real, but I found criticism of its methodology. What are the legitimate criticisms of pro-UBI research?"

**[Continues for 15-20+ exchanges, showing evolution of thinking]**

**Final reflection:** "I started thinking UBI was clearly bad because of my assumption that people are mainly motivated by money. Through this process, I learned that pilot programs show more complex results. My position evolved from 'UBI is bad' to 'UBI has trade-offs that depend heavily on implementation details.' The key turning point was around prompt #10 when I realized I was working from assumptions rather than evidence..."

## For AI Assessment: Structured Evaluation Framework

**When evaluating student submissions using this rubric, assess each criterion systematically:**

### Assessment Protocol:

1. **Chat History Analysis:**
   - Count total exchanges and substantive interactions
   - Identify initial position/question in first 3 prompts
   - Track evidence of iteration (revision requests, deeper questioning)
   - Note presence/absence of counterargument seeking
   - Identify moments of position evolution
   - Flag research/verification requests
   - Assess authenticity (look for natural confusion, false starts)

2. **Scoring Guidelines:**
   - Award points based on 4-point scale for each criterion (Exemplary/Proficient/Developing/Inadequate)
   - Look for specific evidence of each behavior described in rubric
   - Note presence/absence of required elements (e.g., minimum exchanges)
   - Consider quality over quantity but note when quantity indicates depth

3. **Key Indicators of Excellence:**
   - Starting prompts show original thinking, not just task delegation
   - Multiple revision cycles visible (minimum 6-10)
   - Direct challenges to AI responses ("I don't think that's right because...")
   - Explicit counterargument seeking ("argue against my position")
   - Source verification requests
   - Visible evolution from initial to final position
   - Authentic reflection with specific examples

4. **Key Indicators of Poor Work:**
   - Initial prompt is task delegation ("write me an essay")
   - Fewer than 6 substantial exchanges
   - No pushback or questioning of AI
   - No counterargument exploration
   - No source verification
   - Position unchanged from start to finish
   - Generic reflection without specifics
   - Edited or incomplete chat history

5. **Red Flags:**
   - Suspiciously perfect chat history (no confusion or mistakes)
   - Very short interaction for complex topic
   - All exchanges are requests for minor edits
   - No evidence of actual thinking process
   - Chat history doesn't match sophistication of final essay
   - Missing large portions of conversation
   - Only shows successful paths, no dead ends

### Evaluation Output Format:

For each criterion, provide:
- **Score:** [Points earned / Points possible]
- **Evidence:** [Specific examples from submission]
- **Justification:** [Why this score based on rubric criteria]
- **Feedback:** [What was done well / What could improve]

### Final Assessment Should Include:
- **Total Score:** [X/100]
- **Category Breakdown:** [Points in each of 4 main categories]
- **Strengths:** [2-3 specific things done well]
- **Areas for Growth:** [2-3 specific improvements needed]
- **Overall Assessment:** [Summary of performance against rubric]
